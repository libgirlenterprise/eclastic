* Eclastic
  A library for interfacing with [[http://www.elasticsearch.org/][elasticsearch]]
** Introduction
   These are the humble beginnings of an elasticseach client in
   Common Lisp.

** Installation
   You can use [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][roswell]] to install this project from github.
   
   From this fork
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ros install libgirlenterprise/eclastic
#+END_SRC
   
   From original repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ros install gschjetne/eclastic
#+END_SRC
   
** Work in Progress
   I intend to re-write large portions of the library soon, to more
   easily support a greater set of Elasticsearch features.

   If you want to use this for production, drop me a message for the
   latest status.

** Examples
*** Setup
    Tell Eclastic of a place to send requests, whether a server, an
    index or a type within an index:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter *my-documents* (make-instance '<type>
                                              :type "whatever"
                                              :index "highway"
                                              :host "localhost"
                                              :port 9200))
#+END_SRC

*** Fetching a document
    Asks the server for a document. If none exists, it still returns
    an empty document, but a warning is signalled:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (document-by-id *my-documents* "1")
  
  ;; => #<<DOCUMENT> /highway/whatever/1 {10083980C3}>
  
  (handler-case (document-by-id *my-documents* "no-such-doc")
    (document-not-found "Sorry, I couldn't find that document"))
  
  ;; => "Sorry, I couldn't find that document"
  
#+END_SRC

*** Searching
    The query language will be accessible with native Lisp syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (get* *my-documents*
        (new-search (match "adventure" "_all")))
  
  ;; => (#<<DOCUMENT> /highway/whatever/321 {10071F58E3}>
  ;;     #<<DOCUMENT> /highway/whatever/412 {10071F5963}>
  ;;     #<<DOCUMENT> /highway/whatever/431 {10071F59E3}>)
  ;;    (:NUM-HITS 3 :SHARDS (:TOTAL 5 :FAILED 5 :SUCCESSFUL 0) 
  ;;     :TIMED-OUT NIL :TOOK 3)
#+END_SRC
